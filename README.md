Thank you for your interest in the Event Scheduler!

This project is designed to allow people to schedule events of any type; it was adapted from a Sinatra project (also by me) for coordinating protests.

This can be modified or adapted simply by cloning the code from Github (for testing, I have run it with a rails server).

If you wish to contribute, please feel free to do so.
